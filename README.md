-------------

- Clone this repo
- Copy the content of your current `ubuntu-precise` folder to `os/ubuntu-precis`
(**Warning:** don't replace `.gitignore` files!)
- Make sure everything is ok by typing `git status`. You should see this message:
`nothing to commit (working directory clean)`. If it's not the case, try to `git checkout` everything.
